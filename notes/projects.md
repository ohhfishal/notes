Here is a living list of things I am proud of:

## [Daily Quests](https://github.com/ohhfishal/daily-quest)
Simple CRUD app that was mostly refining self-hosting an entire website.

## [Resume Wizard](https://github.com/ohhfishal/resume-wizard)
Tool I made to keep track of resumes and their applications.

## [gotime](https://github.com/ohhfishal/gotime)
CLI timekeeping tool designed to use Go programming principles.
