Inspired by [Go Proverbs](https://go-proverbs.github.io/).
## Code that is not checked into version control does not exist.
## [Legacy code is code without tests](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/what-is-legacy-code-is-it-code-without-tests/).
## Automate what's possible.
## Code is never correct the first time (Or the second).

> [!quote] As Proverbs
> 1. If its not committed, you have not committed.
> 2. The code of tomorrow tells of its today.
> 3. If you do it twice, you'll do it thrice.
> 4. At first you don't succeed. Try, try again.
