From: [Don't ask to ask, just ask](https://dontasktoask.com/)

Rather than ask:
> Any Java experts around?

Instead, ask:
> How do I do \[Problem\] with Java and \[more details\]?

The original:
 - Asks people to take responsibility.
 - Questions people's ability.
 - Excludes potential people who could help. (For example, you may be having a general coding issue that does not require a Java expert.)
