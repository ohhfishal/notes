## Core Problem
Asking about an attempt to solve a problem, rather than the problem itself.
- Get stuck on what one believes the solution to be and in doing so, avoid context needed to solve the problem.
### What to do
- Include info on the bigger picture and your attempted solution(s).
- Provide more detail and context if prompted.
- Share ruled out solutions and **why** as it helps give more info on your specific requirements.
