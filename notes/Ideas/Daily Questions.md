description: App idea?
---

I recently wrote some [code](https://github.com/ohhfishal/daily-quest) to mess around with self hosting a website. An MVP that I could get done and mentally check of as a "completed" project. That as well as [[questions]] got me thinking about the idea of writing down thoughts, but also doing so in a way that could be shared by others. The original [Your Daily Quest](https://yourdaily.quest) was also inspired by app's like [Be Real](https://bereal.com/) and Wordle where its some app you interact with for a brief moment daily.

My first thoughts are to transition the original functionality of the website, but this is something I feel like could be neat as a Discord bot. Content filtering becomes the immediate long-term concern. It being a Discord app does mean there could be some built in "your journals are only shared with people you are friends with" or maybe we could even do a single degree of separation thing. (Of course while also providing safety features for blocking responses from a given user). The bot could also be selective by channel/role/server with the idea being the closer an association you have to the people the more likely you are to get genuine answers.
